        <p>
            I plant all kinds of fruit trees. I keep their height small so I can manage them
            easily. My spare time favorite activity is to tend the garden. I learn to prune trees to make them
            bear lots fruits.
        </p>
        <p>I love fig trees, apple trees, avocado trees.  Fig leaves are good medicine for treating many medical problems.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I also plant all kinds of flower plants. My garden is full of flowers and fruits. My
            friends love to enjoy and relax in my garden.

        <p>
            I focus to be proficient and fast in free style swimming.
            I swim one hour daily in community outdoor pool in crystal clear blue water. I push myself to swim many laps
            in one hour. Swimming is my only exercise.
        </p>
        <p> Swimming is the best cardio exercise for everyone. You exercise arms, legs, neck, lung, heart. You almost
            exercise the entire body.
